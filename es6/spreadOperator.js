const arr2 = [40 ] //applying spread operator [ 23, 98, 55, 54 ] it not showing 40 so now i need to concate the spread operator so now i have to do that create a new variable and put whatever number i wantr to add  and then call the two variable in abother variable with spread operator and now console the last var name
const arr3 =[...arr1, ...arr2]

// arr1.push(40)
console.log(arr3)

// create new array from an older arary and add a elements

const arr2 = [...arr1, 30] // this is a another way to add eleemtns in an array
console.log(arr2)
